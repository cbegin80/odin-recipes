        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The lasagna in the image is a culinary masterpiece, bursting with
            vibrant colors and inviting textures. The golden, slightly crispy
            top layer reveals a generous sprinkle of melted mozzarella and
            Parmesan cheese, browned to perfection. Below the golden crust
            lies a hearty layer of rich, meaty tomato sauce that exudes warmth
            and comfort. You can see the well-cooked, glossy lasagna noodles,
            meticulously arranged in beautiful, alternating layers. Each slice
            promises a harmonious blend of flavors, with the rich tomato sauce
            and melted cheese oozing through the layers, inviting you to savor
            every bite.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven
                over medium heat until well browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and
                water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
                lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
                noodles, and rinse with cold water.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining
                parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of
                a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat
                sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta
                cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with
                1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
                cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil
                with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the
                cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake
                an additional 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
