        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This classic grilled cheese sandwich is a sight to behold. The two
            slices of white bread are perfectly toasted to a golden brown, with
            the melted cheddar cheese oozing out slightly from the middle. The
            sandwich is cut into two neat triangular halves, making it the
            perfect comfort food. Whether enjoyed as a quick snack or a light
            meal, this grilled cheese sandwich promises warmth and satisfaction
            in every bite.
