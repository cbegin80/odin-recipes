        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The meatloaf in the image is a sight to behold, with its rich,
            golden-brown crust and succulent, juicy interior. The top of the
            meatloaf is glazed with a luscious, savory mushroom gravy that
            glistens under the light. The meatloaf itself is a perfect blend of
            ground beef, breadcrumbs, and seasonings, expertly mixed and baked
            to perfection. Each slice promises a burst of flavor, with the
            tender meatloaf melting in your mouth and the rich gravy adding a
            touch of umami goodness. This dish is a classic comfort food that
            will warm your heart and soul with every bite.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>2 cups shiitake mushrooms, diced</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>
                1 (2 1/2 pound) uncooked prepared beef, veal and pork meatloaf
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat.
                Stir in mushrooms and a pinch of salt; cook and stir until
                mushrooms begin to brown, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in fresh rosemary. Add flour and stir to coat the
                mushrooms; cook and stir for about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk in beef broth, 1/2 cup at a time, whisking constantly
                to prevent lumps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn heat to high and bring the sauce to a simmer. Simmer a
                few minutes until sauce starts to thicken. Season with salt
                and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and stir in heavy cream.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slide prepared meatloaf into the sauce. Spoon sauce over
                the top of the meatloaf.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the
                center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees
                F (70 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove pan from the oven and gently remove meatloaf to a
                serving platter.                
            </li>
            <li>Skim off any extra fat from the surface of the sauce.</li>
            <li>
                Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat to reduce
                until thick, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
